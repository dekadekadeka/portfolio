            Originally a Fortran-only program, I decided to make a web-based version not only as a personal challenge, 
            but to be able to show it to anyone with internet access.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned much more than I thought I would from this seemingly small exercise, namely how different languages are better suited for certain applications 
             and how different programming was in the 1950s as opposed to the present day.

            Unfortunately, due to Heroku shutting down their free hosting tier, this project no longer has a backend, 
            meaning the log-in functions and any data that had to be fetched from that backend (pictures and stations) are no longer available.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the train schedule data comes from MARTA's API, the front page (and all its search filters) still works!

          <p>I first discovered coding and web development back in 1999, when the internet was still wild
            and there were few options beyond HTML and the original vanilla JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
              I re-discovered this wonderful world in January of 2019, and it was nothing like how it was when
              I left it about 15 years prior. I studied on my own at first, and in April 22, 2019 I joined
              Flatiron School here in Atlanta, GA to learn full-stack web development.
          </p>
          <p>
              My background in government security and hospitality gives me a unique perspective on the 
              intricacies, attention to detail, and general mentality needed to code effectively. My personal
              hobbies, which include sewing, knitting, and crochet, have a lot in common with coding. The learning 
              process is almost identical (Google, Youtube, and A LOT of repetitive practice) and in my experience,
              they all stimulate the same parts of the brain and offer similar challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
              I enjoy coding for the freedom of choice it gives me in creating applications and in life.
              It opens up opportunities I would not have otherwise. It opened up a whole new world for me.
          </p>
          <p>
              The greatest thing I've ever done was pursue web development.
