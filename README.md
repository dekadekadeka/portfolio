My personal website, [https://www.deka.ooo](https://www.deka.ooo).

This project was originally made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and much later simplified to a single-page basic website. React was overkill for something this small and didn't show off any special skills, so I decided to put everything on a single basic `index.html` page.

*Just think about how much lighter this is without all those `node_modules`...*
